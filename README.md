# Code Annotation and CI/CD Pipeline Project

Welcome to the Code Annotation and CI/CD Pipeline Project! This project is designed to allow annotators to add annotations to code snippets in the frontend, which are then reported to administrators. Additionally, we've implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate code updates on the server whenever changes are committed to the main branch.
